I am a Computing and Information Science Ph.D. student at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), under guidance of Dr. Zhiqiang Tao.
My research focuses on data-centric methods for vision and language models and understanding pretraining and instruction-tuning and adaptation to downstream tasks, including retrieval and question answering. I have also worked on evidential learning and Baysian inference for robust machine learning.
